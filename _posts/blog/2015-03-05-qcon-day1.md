This week, I’ve been lucky enough to attend QCon, it’s taking place at the QE II Conference Centre in London. Have a look at the website for some more details on the background etc. of QCon: <http://qconlondon.com>

This year there are 1200 delegates at the conference, it’s extraordinary seeing that many geeks in one place in London! On the QCon website you can see that the conference itself is over 3 days, each day has a number of different tracks which people can attend. It’s up to use as a delegate what you want to to attend. 
The tracks for Days 1 where:

* Architecture Improvements
* Big Data Frameworks, Architectures and Data Science
* DevOps and Continuous Delivery: Code Beyond the Dev Team
* Mind Matters at Work
* Java - NOT DEAD YET

There are two more tracks each day which are put together by sponsors of the event.

QCon is organised by the same people that produce the InfoQ website which you should look at if you haven’t already done so: <http://www.infoq.com>. It has well written articles on technology topics together with videos from previous QCon conferences.

### Opening Keynote

The opening keynote on Day was given by Russ Olsen (@russolsen), he is a VP at Congnitect see here for more info: <http://russolsen.com/pages/about/>

Russ’s talk was titled “To the Moon”, it was about seeing the bigger picture and very apt for anyone working in tech. The talk takes the audience through the journey when a man landed on the moon, it is a brilliantly narrated by him; it is captivating and puts the listener into the context of what was happening around that time. He talks about reason behind why the US wanted to do this, up to the tense moments when the crew of Apollo 11 were minutes away from physically touching down on the surface of the moon and the post-mortem that followed.

Talks from QCon are not available to non-attendees for a while - but here is the same talk delivered earlier at the GOTO conference in 2014, it is definitely worth watching!

Here is the “live scribe” which was drawn whilst the keynote was going on which summarises the main points:

I’m not going to add any more spoilers - I suggest you watch the video It is inspirational and was a great start to the conference!
