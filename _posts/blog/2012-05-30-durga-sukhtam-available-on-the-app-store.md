It’s been a while since the last post, development has been slow and nothing is being done on the daily commute at the moment. Nevertheless last weekend I found the time to sit down and submit the first app “Durga Sukhtam” to Apple to be reviewed. The app was reviewed in week and it’s now available for [download on the iTunes store](http://j.mp/durga-sukhtam).

The Durga Sukhtam app is a free learning tool to help people learn the Durga Sukhtam, an old vedic chant from the Mahanarayana Upanishad. Vedic chants have been passed on from generation to generation unchanged since very ancient times, the sound aspect is equally important as the words used in the chants. The Durga Sukhtam app helps aspirants studying the Vedas.

The applications is divided into 2 distinct sections, the first section is called “Learn”.  This section of the app helps aspirants by breaking up the chant into bite size stanzas which can be repeated one by one until they are perfected. Each stanza shows the devengiri text and underneath you have the English transliteration and the audio in call-and-response format can be played at the same time. This can be repeated stanza by stanza or can be played continuously. The app is built for touch, you can either user the familiar previous/next buttons or swipe the screen to move between stanzas.

The second section is called “Listen”, this plays the entire Durga Sukhtam the english transliteration and the meaning are displayed along side.

The application has full backgrounding support so you can continue learning whilst using other apps on your device uninterrupted. You can use the audio controls in the tray to pause, play, forward and repeat tracks.

I hope you’ll try the app and give me some of your feedback. I’m really hoping that this app is able to help some of you learn the Durga Sukhtam. The app is free so you’ve got nothing to lose giving it a spin. Let your friends and family know about the app as well, it would be great to see if we can use modern technology to assist us learn and propagate these ancient hymns.
