Durga Sukhtam has been on the apple app store for just over a month now, I’ve been listening to feedback from users of the app and decided it was time to put out an updated with some of the requested enhancements. You can download the app from the iTunes app store here: <http://j.mp/durga-sukhtam>

In this release when your iPhone or iPod Touch is locked you’ll be able to see more information in the lock screen:

The lock screen has details of the stanza being played and it’s now clear which app is in the background as your lock screen will have a beautifully rendered image of the lion used as in the home screen icon.

Just as we’re showing more information in the home screen the music dock how also shows you exactly which stanza is being played.

Finally, one much requested feature for people aspiring to learn the sukhtam – the ability to change the speed of the audio. In the bottom toolbar you will now see an a button which allows you to toggle between 3 different speeds.
