**...since I've written a post.**

So what happened?

I put the Durga Sukhtam app on the app store over a year ago and you probably thought that there hasn't been much going on in terms of development since then. The app has been downloaded more than four thousand times and I find that pretty amazing for something quite niche. I think it's quite cool how people in countries such as Iraq, Nepal, Portugal etc. have downloaded the app. I will put some stats out later on so you can see what's happened.

I've not forgotten about app development... 

I've just not finished anything recently!! I have had ideas which are half coded and sitting on my laptop and I'm going to start getting some of these out on the app store soon. I submitted an app for review to Apple last week and put a post on here as soon as it's ready for people to download. It is like my previous app, so anyone that enjoyed learning the Durga Sukhtam should like the second edition to the family.

Android... yes, still getting requests to port the app on to Android and I've recently bought a Nexus 4. I might get something out soon but my immediate priority is to work on some experiments in iOS land. 

Anyway - just wanted to let you know that I'm still here ;-)
