Hi All,

As many of you know I have a passion for technology, love gadgets and a bit of a geek. Over the last few years I haven’t really written that much code, something that I actually enjoy! A few months back I decided that I’ll make it a mini-project of mine to get my hands dirty once again and in the next few weeks I hope to be releasing my first iPhone and iPod Touch app on the App Store.

The app is a free learning tool to help people learn the Durga Sukhtam, an old vedic chant from the Mahanarayana Upanishad. I know that this may sound a little unusual to a quite a few of you out there but hopefully it will make the task of learning this vedic chant a lot easier for anyone that’s tried.

I have got a few ideas for other apps that I’d like to build and would love to hear from you if you have any ideas that we could bring to reality… BTW, that’s a very strong ‘could’, I have a day job which means I’m working long hours and most of the coding and design for this app has been done thanks to my commute on the Metropolitan tube line. As you can imagine, it’s not going to be quick from idea to finished product!

The Durga Sukhtam app and any others that I produce will be released under the 12nines umbrella. If you think that this is something that you would be interested and would like to be notified of when it’s released then please subscribe to the 12nines notifications by following this link: <http://j.mp/12nines-signup>.

I promise not to send you any spam or give away your email address to anyone else, I don’t expect to be sending more than a few emails every month.

If you think that that there are others out there that would be interested in this app then I would appreciate it if you could also ask them to subscribe to the mailing list.

Alternatively, I’ll be posting updates on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/12nines/198570890247992) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/12nines) so go on and like/follow the pages. If you are old school and just wanted to be notified by RSS then point your RSS reader at [http://12nines.com](http://12nines.com/). Is there anyone out there that uses [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/107813958410653639240/) ?

If you are interested in becoming a beta tester for software that I’m building then please indicate your preferences when you subscribe.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.
