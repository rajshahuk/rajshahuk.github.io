Well and truly getting started with some adventures on this [Maha Shivaratri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maha_Shivaratri) night of 2012. I have had the 12nines.com domain for a while and I thought that this was a good a time as any to get myself started on a new journey. I’ll be updating the About section on this site over the next couple of days with a little more information on why in particular I have decided to roll with 12nines.

Over the last couple of hours, I’ve been a nerd and setup an account on [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/), provisioned a server on the ‘Elastic Cloud’ loaded up a full LAMP environment, changed my DNS settings to point to this server in the cloud… I know it’s sad, but it has been fun!

As a techie junkie at heart, I think a first entry called ‘Hello World’ is still quite apt. Signing out now…
