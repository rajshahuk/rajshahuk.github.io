As a follow up to Day 1 (which was Wednesday) here is what I got up to yesterday at QCon. The tracks for Day 2 were:

* Docker, containers and application portability
* Evolving Agile
* The Go Language
* Internet of Things
* Reactive Architecture
* HTML and JS Today
* Modern CS in the Real World

Again - 2 more tracks from the sponsors of the event.

### Day 2 Keynote

The keynote for Day 2 was delivered by John Wilkes, Principal Software Engineer, Technical Infrastructure, Google. The talk was titled “Cluster Management at Google” - which did sound a bit bland.

John works on what he calls the most powerful cloud platform on the planet, Google have been working on this for more than 15 years. His opening statement was - nothing every works quite right, and he used examples of scaling on the cluster manager to show how this. 

The slides below show his main talk.

John mentioned Kubernetes (<http://kubernetes.io>) - Google’s open source cluster manager for containers - it’s not yet version 1.0 but it is probably something that we should be looking at. This is probably a good example of where we shouldn’t be ‘rolling our own’ with a JFDI mentality. One the echo’ing themes that this year is that some of this stuff is really… I mean really hard. I will post on this later but companies like Netflix, Google, eBay have had to create some stuff themselves because it didn’t exist but if they had the choice now they probably would take something else off the shelf using the learnings from other people. In nearly every case, there is a stable Open Source project where these large companies have contributed back.

The other theme, I’d briefly like to pull out is the need for experimentation - we never know enough just by reading a white paper or have a sales guy come and talk to us about their super software. The best way is try it out, create a hypothesis, test it, iterate, fail early or expand. We should be doing this all the time; it should be done in small time boxed cycles and if it can’t be done then it’s wrong. Stop.

Here is the live scribe from today’s keynote - hopefully it gives you a flavour for what was discussed together with the slides:

I’ve also managed to find the same subject/talk on YouTube delivered at MesoConf in 2014:

On Day 2 I attended the following talks - links to slides are also posted here:

* Back to the Future: what ever happened to being eXtreme? by Rachel Davies >> This was an awesome talk about *being* agile. I will write this one up later as there are no slides published.
* The Art of Protocol Design by Pieter Hintjens - no slides either because Peter didn’t use any slides 
* The business of front-end development by Rachel Andrew - <http://qconlondon.com/system/files/presentation-slides/qcon-business-of-front-end.pdf>
* Progress from "What?" and "So what?" to "NOW WHAT?” by Larry Maccherone - <http://qconlondon.com/system/files/presentation-slides/Larry%20Maccherone%20-%20What%20-%20So%20what%20-%20Now%20what.pdf>
* Why BDD can save agile by Matt Wynne - <http://qconlondon.com/system/files/presentation-slides/How%20BDD%20Can%20Save%20Agile%20-%20Matt%20Wynne.pdf>
* How to Train your Docker Cloud by Andrew Kennedy - no slides - I’ll be honest - it wasn’t for my cup of tea, happy to talk to people about it, I made notes but essentially this was about running Docker across multiple cloud providers

Thanks!
