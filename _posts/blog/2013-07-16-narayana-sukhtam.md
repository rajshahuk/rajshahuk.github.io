Last week Apple approved the [**Narayana Sukhtam**](http://j.mp/narayana-sukhtam) app for distribution through the iTunes store. As I mentioned in an earlier post, I've got some half finished apps sitting on my laptop and I thought I would finish these and put them on to the App Store.

You can download the app from here: [http://j.mp/narayana-sukhtam](http://j.mp/narayana-sukhtam)

The Narayana Sukhtam app was originally written this time last year to help people trying to learn this vedic chant. As always I'm interested in feedback that you have and if there is anything in particular that you'd like to see.

If you are interested in apps that I'm builing don't forget that you can you subsribe to the 12nines mailing list here: [http://j.mp/12nines-signup](http://j.mp/12nines-signup)
